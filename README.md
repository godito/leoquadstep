# leoquadstep
A modification to use the SparkFun Quadstepper Stepmotor Driver Board with the Leonardo instead the Mega.
Just connect all STPs to pin 10, DIR and ENx wherever you like, then enable the bus. The board will then run with a fixed step size of 1/16. 
To use stepsizes, connect MS1-3 accordingly.
This is a not very thoroughly tested version which compiled flawlessly on IDE 1.5.6.
